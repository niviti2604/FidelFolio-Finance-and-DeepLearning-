    "# 📊 Company Time-Series Imputation and Outlier Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs **data imputation and correction** on a longitudinal company dataset. The dataset contains yearly feature values for multiple companies, some of which are **missing, inconsistent, or anomalous** due to reporting gaps or data entry errors. Our goal is to create a **complete, clean, and trustworthy dataset** for downstream analysis or modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The process consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Temporal Expansion**\n",
    "For each company, we expand the timeline from its **first available year** (assumed founding year) to **2020**, even if feature data is missing for intermediate years. This ensures consistency in the timeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Spatial Founding Year Imputation**\n",
    "If a company's feature values are missing in its founding year, we impute them using **spatial nearest neighbors**—i.e., similar companies in the same year based on feature similarity. This helps initialize missing sequences with realistic starting values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Temporal Imputation**\n",
    "We apply **IterativeImputer** from `sklearn` for time-aware imputation. This approach models each feature as a function of the others and iteratively fills missing values. To enhance continuity over time, we also apply **linear interpolation** across the company's timeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Spatial Outlier Correction**\n",
    "We detect outliers in each year using **Isolation Forest**, a robust anomaly detection method. Identified outliers are corrected by replacing them with the **median of the three nearest non-outlier neighbors**, preserving the company’s contextual similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Final Validation and Export**\n",
    "We validate that all missing values are imputed and outliers corrected. The cleaned dataset is exported as `Imputed_Complete_Company_Years.csv`, retaining the original target labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each company's first valid year is treated as the founding year.\n",
    "- Nearest neighbors are computed using standardized feature vectors.\n",
    "- Outlier detection is done per year to maintain spatial consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline is designed to be **modular, interpretable, and scalable**, suitable for both exploratory analysis and predictive modeling.\n"

    "The model is based on a **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)** network, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). The key elements are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GRU Layer**: The GRU unit is designed to capture the temporal dependencies in the data by maintaining a hidden state that is updated over time. The update rule for the GRU is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  `h_t = (1 - z_t) * h_(t-1) + z_t * h_tilde`\n",

    "- `z_t` is the update gate (how much of the previous state to keep),\n",
    "- `h_tilde` is the candidate hidden state, and\n",
    "- `*` represents element-wise multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dropout Layer**: Dropout is used to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the inputs to zero during training. This regularization technique helps the model generalize better.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dense Layer**: A fully connected layer that outputs a single value, which is the predicted target for each sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is trained to minimize the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** loss function, which is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Dropout rate**: This controls the probability of setting an input to zero in the dropout layer.\n",
    "- **Learning rate**: The rate at which the model adjusts its weights during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of hyperparameter tuning is to find the best combination of these parameters that minimizes the validation loss (MSE).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏋️‍♂️ Model Training\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "  `θ_t = θ_(t-1) - η * (m_t / √(v_t) + ε)`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **LSTM Model**:\n",
    "The **LSTM** model consists of the following layers:\n",
    "- **LSTM Layer**: A recurrent layer to capture temporal dependencies in the data.\n",
    "- **Dropout Layer**: To prevent overfitting.\n",
    "- **Dense Layer**: Outputs a single value prediction for `Target 3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **CNN-LSTM Model**:\n",
    "The **CNN-LSTM** model combines convolutional layers with LSTM layers:\n",
    "- **CNN Layer**: The convolutional layer extracts local patterns from sequences of features.\n",
    "- **LSTM Layer**: Captures long-term dependencies from the CNN-extracted features.\n",
    "- **Dropout Layer**: Prevents overfitting.\n",
    "- **Dense Layer**: Outputs a single value prediction for `Target 3`.\n",
    "\n",

    "Using **Random Search**, the following hyperparameters are tuned for both models:\n",
    "- **LSTM**: Number of units, dropout rate, and learning rate.\n",
    "- **CNN-LSTM**: Filters in the convolutional layer, kernel size, LSTM units, dropout rate, and learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the **EarlyStopping** callback to stop training if the validation loss does not improve for 5 consecutive epochs.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5. **Model Evaluation**\n",
    "After training, the models are evaluated on the test data using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, which is a common metric to measure the accuracy of regression models. The formula for RMSE is:\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, we explore three traditional machine learning models—**Decision Tree Regressor**, **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**, and **Linear Regression**—for predicting `Target 3`. The process follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Data Preprocessing**\n",
    "   - **Flattening Sequences**: For non-RNN models, the 3D sequences are reshaped into 2D arrays using `.reshape()`. This is done for both training and testing data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Model Implementations**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Decision Tree Regressor**:\n",
    "   - A **Decision Tree Regressor** is tuned using **GridSearchCV**, where the hyperparameters like `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, and `min_samples_leaf` are optimized.\n",
    "   - The **best parameters** from the grid search are used to train the model and predict on the test data.\n",
    "   - The performance of the model is evaluated using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, which is printed alongside the best hyperparameters found during grid search.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**:\n",
    "   - An **SVR** model is created with a **Pipeline**, where data scaling (`StandardScaler()`) is applied first, followed by training the SVR model.\n",
    "   - The hyperparameters (`C`, `epsilon`, and `kernel`) are tuned using **GridSearchCV**.\n",
    "   - The performance is evaluated using **RMSE**, which is printed with the best hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Linear Regression**:\n",
    "   - A simple **Linear Regression** model is trained on the flattened data, and predictions are made.\n",
    "   - The performance is evaluated using **RMSE**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Model Evaluation**\n",
    "Each model is evaluated using **RMSE** on the test data:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}\n",

    "   - **Input Shape Adjustment**: The input dimensions are updated based on the actual data shape (3 timesteps and 28 features).\n",
    "   - **Tuning Hyperparameters**: The model uses **RandomSearch** to optimize hyperparameters such as:\n",
    "     - Number of **LSTM units** (between 32 and 256).\n",
    "     - Number of **dense units** and **activation functions** for the fully connected layer.\n",
